========

Ever think to yourself "Where the hell did this method get defined?" So did I.  Now I include this file before my stuff boots, then I grep the output.  

## .plan ##
In future versions, I would like to use the object\_id to explicitly call out when methods are being overridden in classes, and to let you pass in an object and a symbol for the method name and get a useful diagram about how and where the method was defined.
